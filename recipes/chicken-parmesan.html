        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This chicken Parmesan pasta is the perfect, simple dish to lure kids into the kitchen — what kid doesn't like chicken tenders and spaghetti? This dish is loaded with mini cooking lessons, too. With one simple recipe, kids learn how to boil pasta, mince garlic, grate cheese, make tomato sauce, and pound, bread, and sauté cutlets. Bonus: This recipe makes twice the sauce needed, so freeze half for another meal.</p>
